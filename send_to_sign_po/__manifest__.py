        Digital Signing Workflow for Purchase Orders
        --------------------------------------------

        This module enhances the Purchase Order workflow by integrating Odoo Sign
        and adding automated revision/version control.

        Key Features:
        • Adds a “Send to Sign” button for confirmed Purchase Orders.
        • Generates a printable PO PDF and sends it to Odoo Sign for digital signatures.
        • Automatically tracks signature progress and updates PO signature state.
        • Displays signature status inside the form view and list view.
        • Implements full revision control (R-1, R-2, …) for signed POs.
        • Automatically resets signature state and increments revision when PO data changes.
        • Shows revision number directly in the PO PDF.
        • Prevents repeated signing unless changes are made after the last completed signature.

        This provides a clean, controlled, and auditable digital approval process for purchasing.
